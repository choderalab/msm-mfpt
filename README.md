Evaluating MSM-estimated mean first passage times


Here we will evaluate mean-first-passage-time estimates from Markov State Models and milestone-based variants. We also evaluate and propose methods for selecting the milestones.

Defining states
In the future we can consider another clustering strategy accounting for uncertainties in rates:
